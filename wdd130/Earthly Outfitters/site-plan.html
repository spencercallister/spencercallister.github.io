      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I want to connect people with used clothes in good quality. Essentially an online thrift store. This would be beneficial to people with low incomes and high incomes, and the environment. My site will give thrifters a way to shop from home and fill their taste for fashion at an affordable level. <br>Have you ever been to a clothing store and wondered why everything costed so much? Used clothing that is almost perfect in quality is sometimes a quarter the cost of something that is brand new. Clothing should be affordable and also sustainable. So I will provide both affordability and sustainability!</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Our audience are those who want to help keep the earth free of fast fabrics and people seeking affordable and decent clothing. We will be directed towards young adults in the Idaho/Wyoming Teton area who are looking for clothes that they can afford on their very limited budget. We are also very directed towards people who want to make a difference in the world by eliminating the cost that the mass production of fabric has on our ecosystem.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <p>
        The fashion industry is responsible for 10 percent of our global emissions. This means that fast fabric producers like H&M, Target, Forever 21 and other major producers are harming our environment by the sheer amount of fabric they produce. Not to mention the large number of people employed at wages that are not survivable in third world countries by these companies. There is no reason to produce the amount of fabric that humans have for decades, and we can cut down on the extremely high production rate just by reusing. We can recycle clothing but often the stigma around wearing pre owned clothing is a bit uncomfortable. This is why we take extra measures to ensure that what we sell is clean and in great quality. Together we can eliminate the amount of fabric produced to help lower the damage the fashion industry has made on the Earth. Here at Earthly Outfitters, you can assist by buying clothing already worn rather than increasing the already large demand for clothing in our society. We ensure all our fabric is in a high or medium quality state, so it is still as if you are buying it brand new! When you come to Earthly Outfitters, you are helping the entire world by benefiting its ecosystem through the reduction of waste. This means you can get a new look and help the environment!

      <h3>Sustainability</h3>
      <p>
        At Earthly Outfitters, we really want to bring you an affordable option for clothing. College students and young people in general, as well as people in older and younger age groups often cannot afford the high cost that retailers typically charge for their things. So we will help out! Our site will connect you with people who have an abundance of clothes and want to see their jackets, t-shirts, jeans, shoes, and other items get put to good use. Visit our “Buy” page to see all the great items we are offering! If you have clothes you wish to get rid of but are also looking for a source of income and feel like you are wasting perfectly good items, look to us to help you sell those and make you a bit of profit too! We offer direct transfers and store credit when you want to sell your things through our “Sell” page. Our business offers a recycling program as well which will take the clothing that we cannot except because of damage and wear and tear and reuse it for brand new clothes. When selling clothes to us, simply take a picture of your item’s front/back and inside, attach it to a message on our site’s messaging feature, and send it to us. From there, we will determine what it is worth and send you money for your clothes.

      <h3>Volunteer</h3>
      <p>Along with our business, we also offer volunteer opportunities to help clean up the earth a bit in the Teton Idaho Wyoming area. During these outings we collect trash in our national parks and other nature reserves to benefit the fauna and flora. We partner up with local organizations to clean the Earth and invite individuals and other companies to make a pledge to make one step at a time towards a healthier planet. Here on our site, you can sign up to join others in our community who want to keep the planet clean and make a difference one step at a time. If you want to volunteer, use the “Join Us” box on our “Volunteer” section to join us on our next adventure. Fighting climate change is a process that is done community by community and this is how we are helping ours.</p>
